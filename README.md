# Decant

**Convert files to Markdown before they upload.**

Decant converts documents to Markdown directly within the LLM UI but on your local machine, without interrupting your workflow or risking privacy concerns by using online conversion.  

At its core is a surface-agnostic pipeline — `intercept → route → transform → substitute`.
The first surface implemented is a Chrome extension that catches a PDF or Word
doc as you attach it to an LLM chat and swaps in the Markdown version in place. 
Further surfaces (a Claude Desktop MCP server, native
desktop, mobile) are mapped in [`docs/SURFACES.md`](./docs/SURFACES.md).

The name is a metaphor: pour the document into a lighter, cleaner vessel and
leave the heavy sediment behind. For LLMs, that sediment is the **image layer** —
many chat backends render every page of a PDF as an image and bill you for it
alongside the text. Handing the model Markdown instead drops that cost. The model spends tokens on your content,
not on re-reading pictures of pages.

## Why

Uploading a raw PDF to an LLM is often the most expensive way to share it. A
document whose actual text is modest can balloon in token cost once each page is
rendered as an image. Converting to Markdown up front:

- **Cuts token cost** — biggest wins on text-heavy PDFs.
- **Keeps structure** — headings, lists, and tables survive better as Markdown
  than as a flattened page image.
- **Stays on your machine** — conversion is local by default; your documents
  don't go to a third party.

The catch Decant respects: the image layer isn't pure waste. It's what lets a
model read charts, scans, and complex tables. So Decant **never converts
blindly** — visually-heavy documents can pass through untouched, and you stay in
control of what gets transformed.

---

## How it works

Under the hood, Decant is a small, general pipeline:

```
intercept  →  route by file type  →  transform  →  substitute back into the upload
```

Conversion is split along the line that actually matters — **parsing vs.
recognition**:

- **Parsing** (fast, in-browser, zero install): reading data that's already
  structured. Digital PDFs carry a real text layer; Office files (DOCX/XLSX) are
  just zipped XML. This is handled in the browser with mature JS libraries.
- **Recognition** (optional local companion): turning pixels into structure —
  OCR on scanned pages, neural table extraction, figure description. This needs
  real models, so it runs in an optional local helper process you can install
  if and when you want that quality tier.

For most everyday uploads — clean PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets — the in-browser
path is the right tool, and nothing extra needs to run.

---

## Configuration

Two independent layers, both **default-off**:

### Activation — where Decant runs
Decant does nothing on any page unless its host is explicitly whitelisted. It
ships with `claude.ai`, `chatgpt.com`, and `gemini.google.com` enabled (with
other common LLM hosts pre-listed but off). claude.ai and ChatGPT get the full
treatment — picker, drag-and-drop, and paste all substitute the converted
file. Gemini converts through the file picker only; its uploader rejects
synthetic drops, so on Gemini drag-and-drop/paste intentionally send the
original file unconverted rather than lose it.
Manage the list from the **options page**. Enabling a host asks Chrome for
permission to run there and registers the content script dynamically, so the
install prompt stays minimal and nothing injects into sites you haven't opted in.

### Routing — what happens to each file type
Rules keyed by MIME type / extension decide each file's fate:

- `inbrowser` — convert with the built-in JS engines
- `companion` — send to the local helper for high-fidelity / OCR
- `http` — send to any endpoint you configure and substitute the result
- `passthrough` — leave the file untouched (the default for anything unmatched)

Defaults route PDFs and Word docs to Markdown; everything else passes through
until you say otherwise. Because routing is generic, you can point any file type
at any endpoint — e.g. route images to a local OCR service and have the extracted
text dropped into the upload.

> **Privacy note:** routing to a non-`localhost` endpoint means a document leaves
> your machine. Decant warns you before that happens; it's always an opt-in.

---

## Install (development)

Decant isn't packaged for the Web Store yet. To run the work-in-progress locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtrachtenberg/decant.git
cd decant
npm install
npm run build      # emits the unpacked extension to dist/
```

Then load it in Chrome:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `dist/` folder

### Optional: the local companion (recognition tier)

For OCR and high-fidelity conversion of image-heavy documents:

```bash
cd companion
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py   # serves on http://127.0.0.1:8765 by default
```

Decant talks to it over `localhost` only. If it isn't running, routes that depend
on it fall back gracefully (in-browser conversion or passthrough).

## Roadmap

- **M0 — Hello, swap. ✅ Complete.** Interception proven: file picker,
  drag-and-drop, and paste uploads on `claude.ai` are intercepted and the file
  is substituted before the site sees it.
- **M1 — In-browser conversion. ✅ Complete.** Real PDF→Markdown via pdf.js
  across all three intake paths (picker, drag-and-drop, paste). A content
  classifier decides per document — **convert** (text), **passthrough** (scans /
  no usable text), or **ambiguous** (text plus image-charts). The extracted
  Markdown carries heading and table structure, and multi-column pages are
  reflowed into reading order (column-by-column) rather than left interleaved.
  Two manual overrides put you in control: ambiguous documents prompt a per-file
  **Convert to Markdown / Send original** choice, and a **passthrough hotkey**
  (`Alt+Shift+O`) arms the next upload to be sent untouched. (Making the hotkey
  binding user-configurable comes with the options page in M2.)
- **M2 — Polish & config. ✅ Complete.** An options page now manages the
  activation whitelist (default-deny, with dynamic content-script registration
  and per-host permission prompts), the passthrough hotkey binding, and the
  **routing table** — ordered per-type rules
  (`inbrowser` / `companion` / `http` / `passthrough`) deciding each
  intercepted file's fate, with whole-config JSON import/export and a warning
  whenever a rule points at a non-localhost endpoint. The `http` / `companion`
  transport is live: matching files POST to the configured endpoint from the
  background worker (multipart or base64-JSON, per-rule response parsing and
  output naming), and any endpoint failure takes the rule's fallback —
  in-browser conversion or passthrough — so a dead endpoint can never lose an
  upload. A zero-dependency mock endpoint (`npm run mock-endpoint`) doubles as
  the executable contract for the M3 companion service. **DOCX → Markdown**
  now converts in-browser via mammoth.js: headings and emphasis survive,
  inline images are never dropped silently (documents that contain them get
  the same Convert / Send-original prompt PDFs do), and stored configs migrate
  to include the new default rule. **XLSX/XLS → Markdown tables** via SheetJS:
  one table per sheet, empty and very large workbooks pass through untouched.
  (Raster images in spreadsheets can't be detected by the community
  SheetJS build — the one format without an "ambiguous" prompt.)
  **PPTX → Markdown**: slide titles become headings, body text becomes
  leveled bullets, and slide tables become Markdown tables. Native **charts
  are recovered as data** — a chart isn't an image but a cached data series in
  the file, so Decant reads it straight into a category×series table (often
  more useful to a model than the picture was); a slide whose only visual is a
  recovered chart converts cleanly; DOCX charts (which mammoth would otherwise
  drop) and XLSX charts are recovered the same way, though a spreadsheet chart
  often just restates cells already in a sheet. Pasted-in pictures still get the Convert /
  Send-original prompt.
  **HTML → Markdown** via Turndown (+ GFM tables): scripts, styles, and tag
  soup — most of a raw HTML file's token cost — are stripped away; remote
  images survive as ordinary Markdown image links, embedded data-URI images
  get omission markers and the prompt. Wherever conversion drops a visual
  (PDF pages, DOCX, PPTX, HTML), the output now says so in place:
  `[image omitted: label]`.
  The **packaging pass** has landed too: toolbar/store icons, production name,
  a `Required Notice` + commercial-licensing contact in the license, and a
  pre-publish [smoke checklist](./docs/smoke-checklist.md).
  Per-site adapters now cover claude.ai and ChatGPT with full drop/paste
  conversion (Gemini stays picker-only by necessity). And after a conversion,
  a brief badge shows the **estimated token savings** — the eliminated
  page-image layer that is the whole point, made visible (a labeled estimate;
  PDFs today, where the per-page image cost is what conversion removes).
- **M3 — Companion tier & the image layer.** Local Python service for OCR /
  high-fidelity tables, plus **figure descriptions** (Docling/MarkItDown turn
  charts and images into inline text — the recognition tier the in-browser
  engines can't provide). Alongside it, **extract-and-reference**: attach the
  converted Markdown *plus* the document's actual figures as sibling files
  (free for PPTX/DOCX, whose images are just zip entries), so the model pays
  image tokens only for figures that matter — likely a third choice on the
  ambiguous prompt ("Convert + attach figures").
- **M4 — Profiles.** Per-host overrides on the global config: convert PDFs to
  Markdown everywhere, but always pass through on one site, or forward a file
  type to a specific endpoint on another. Same rule shape as global routing,
  merged per file type and resolved most-specific-wins (one-shot hotkey → site
  profile → global). Design in `SPEC.md` §3.8 and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2.1.

## License

Decant is released under the **PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0** — see
[`LICENSE`](./LICENSE). You're free to use, modify, and share it for any
**non-commercial** purpose; commercial use by others isn't granted. The rationale
is recorded in
[`docs/adr/0001-license-polyform-noncommercial.md`](./docs/adr/0001-license-polyform-noncommercial.md).

A note on terms: this makes Decant **source-available**, not "open source" in the
OSI sense (the OSI and FSF definitions don't permit non-commercial restrictions).
That's a deliberate choice, not an oversight.

**Commercial use** — noncommercial covers individuals, hobby projects, and
nonprofits/education/government (see the license for the full list). A for-profit
company using Decant internally (e.g. rolling it out across a team or bundling it
into a deployment image) is *not* covered and needs a separate commercial license.
If that's you, reach out at **j.trachtenberg@gmail.com** — happy to sort it out.

Third-party dependencies keep their own permissive licenses (see
[`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES`](./THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES)). Any GPL-licensed conversion tools
are used only at arm's length via the separate companion process, never bundled
into the extension.
